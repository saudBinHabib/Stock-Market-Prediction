# Stock Market Prediction

In this repo, I will try to predict Stock prices based on Stock prices of previous days. The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.

This is a time series analysis and we will see simple eight ways to predict the Stock prices. The various models to be used are:

1. Average
2. Weighted Average
3. Moving Average
4. Moving Weighted Average
5. Linear Regression
6. Weighted Linear Regression
7. Lasso Regression
8. Gradient Boosting Regressor
